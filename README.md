# fall21Git

This is a repo for my Fall 2021 semester at Southeast Missouri State University (SEMO).
I am taking:
 - CS265 (Computer Science 2)
 - CS288 (Computer System and Assembly Language)
 - CS351 (C & The Posix Enviroment)
 
 For these classes, CS265 Uses Java programming, CS288 uses MIPS Assembly Language, and CS351 is learning the C Language.
 
 Feel free to reach out if you need help understanding the code or if you find an error in one of my programs.
